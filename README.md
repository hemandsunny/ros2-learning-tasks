# ros2-learning-tasks
The goal of this project is to build a solid understanding of core ROS 2 principles (nodes, topics, launch files, custom packages) and their application in a realistic, simulated environment.

Task 1 - Simulate tortoisebot.urdf in Gazebo and run it using Teleop
Task 2 - Get nearest object distance using LiDAR and laser filters
